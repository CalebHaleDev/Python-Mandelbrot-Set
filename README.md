# Python-Mandelbrot-Set Overview

Purpose: Create and analyze the Mandelbrot set! This project is meant for me to practice learning Python and using it to analyze data. Hopefully I can get something ready to display the results in a graph for easier viewing of the results. Even with just printing digits, you can see what it is generating. I designed it to print at varied levels of detail and noticed what it printed wasn't the Mandelbrot set (a fractal-like shape creating my graphing the results of repeatedly squaring complex numbers and adding a constant to it each iteration). I didn't find a free data set for the Mandelbrot set, so I decided to generate my own copies with the desired precision. I wrote this software mainly to learn and practice python by analyzing the Mandelbrot set, but it was fun trying to figure out where I went wrong in generating the set. I have previously made my own Mandelbrot generator, so I decided to compare the code for each. (Seeing the digit 7 when the iteration count should be limited to 10000, yielding a log digit of 5 max hinting something was wrong in either the interation of the generator or the display of the results.)

{Provide a description of the data set that you are analyzing.  Include the link of where you obtained the data.}

# Data Analysis Results

{List the questions and the answers you found by doing this analysis.}

# Development Environment

I used Visual Studio Code to write the program, importing math (for the logarithm digit printing) and sys (for the same-line printing of each digit).
