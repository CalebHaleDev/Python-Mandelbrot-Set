# Python-Mandelbrot-Set Overview

Create and analyze the Mandelbrot set! This project is meant for me to practice learning Python and using it to analyze data. Hopefully I can get something ready to display the results in a graph for easier viewing of the results.

{Provide a description of the data set that you are analyzing.  Include the link of where you obtained the data.}

{Describe your purpose for writing this software to analyze the data.}

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the data set, the questions and answers, the code running and a walkthrough of the code.}
